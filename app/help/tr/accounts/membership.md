# Üyelikler

BitShares'teki hesaplar üç gruba ayrılmıştır. We decided to give users the option to upgrade their accounts into a VIP-like status if they desire and profit from reduced fees and additional features.

## Üye olmayanlar

A *regular* account is a *non-member*.

## Ömür boyu üyeler

Lifetime Members get a percentage cashback on every transaction fee they pay and qualify to earn referral income from users they register with or referer to the network. A Lifetime membership is associated with a certain one-time fee that is defined by the committee.

## Yıllık Üyeler

Bir ömür boyu üyelik çok fazla ise, yine de aynı nakit parayı alabilirsin. gelecek yıl bir yıllık bir abone olabilirsin sadece bir yıl sürer.

### Ücret Bölümü

Every time an account you referred pays a transaction fee, that fee is divided among several different accounts. The network takes a cut, and the Lifetime Member who referred the account gets a cut.

The registrar is the account that paid the transaction fee to register the account with the network. The registrar gets to decide how to divide the remaining fee between themselves and their own affiliate.

### Bekleyen Ücretler

Fees paid are only divided among the network, referrers, and registrars once every maintenance interval.

### Vesting Fees

Most fees are made available immediately, but fees over the vesting threshold (such as those paid to upgrade your membership or register a premium account name) must vest for some days as defined by the committee.
