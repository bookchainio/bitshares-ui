# 会员

BitShares中的帐户分成三组。 我们决定给用户选择以升级到类似VIP的账户，如果他们的愿望并且能够从降低的费用和更多的功能里受益。

## 非会员

*普通*帐户是*非会员*。

## 终生会员

生存期成员在他们付的每笔交易费用中获得一个百分比返还，并有资格从他们介绍注册的用户那里获得介绍费。 A Lifetime membership is associated with a certain one-time fee that is defined by the committee.

## Anual Members

If a lifetime membership is too much you can still get the same cashback for the next year by becoming an annual subscriber for a smaller one-time fee which lasts for only one year.

### Fee Division

Every time an account you referred pays a transaction fee, that fee is divided among several different accounts. The network takes a cut, and the Lifetime Member who referred the account gets a cut.

The registrar is the account that paid the transaction fee to register the account with the network. The registrar gets to decide how to divide the remaining fee between themselves and their own affiliate.

### Pending Fees

Fees paid are only divided among the network, referrers, and registrars once every maintenance interval.

### Vesting Fees

Most fees are made available immediately, but fees over the vesting threshold (such as those paid to upgrade your membership or register a premium account name) must vest for some days as defined by the committee.
