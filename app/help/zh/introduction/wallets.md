# 钱包

你也行已经注意到，这个应用程序是网络应用程序，在浏览器中运行。 与网络中可信节点所建立的连接，是到生态系统其余部分的网关。

## 云钱包

如果你用用户名和密码注册，那么你拥有一个云钱包。 虽然技术上没有任何东西存储在云中，我们使用云钱包这个术语，因为您可以使用这些凭证 (用户名和密码) 从任何网络浏览器在任何时候访问您的帐户。 云钱包只允许一次访问一个帐户。 这通常是新用户的正确选择。 While it is possible to change the auto-generated password, we do not recommend doing so at this time. The team is working on a responsible way to manage the password change that requires no technical knowledge. We will make an announcement once it's released.

## Local Wallet

The local wallet creates a database within your browser. This means that access to your funds it tied to **that browser only**. If you attempt to access your local wallet from any other computer, or any other browser, it will fail unless you actively import your backup file from the original browser backup file. The process actually easy. See managing [backups](/help/introduction/backups).

## Security

Rest assured that our servers do not have access to your funds because none of your private keys ever leave your browser. Instead, they are encrypted with your passphrase and are stored in your local browser's database. As such, you should make sure to have a proper [Backup](../introduction/backups.md) in the event something happens to your computer or browser.

## Management

The user interface is capable of carrying and accessing several separated wallets each containing possible several accounts and corresponding funds. You can create, backup, and switch existing wallets in `Settings->Wallets`.
