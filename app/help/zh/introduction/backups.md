# 备份

建议经常性备份你的钱包，虽然在大多数情况下单个备份以及足够。 请注意为了从备份中恢复，你将需要提够密码短语，因为**备份是被加密的**。 因此，无论是你丢失你的钱包还是丢失你的密码短语，你都将不能再存取你的资金！

备份可以从钱包管理控制板获得(`设置 -> 钱包`)。

## 钱包导出

The most convenient way to create a new backup is by exporting the wallet with the provided link in the Wallet Management Console. Please store your backups safe from loss, theft, and natural catastrophes

## Brainkey (advanced users ONLY)

If you never manually imported an account key into your wallet, you can alternatively backup your accounts and their funds by exporting the *brainkey*, a string of words from which your keys are derived deterministically.

## Remark: Hierarchical Authorities (advanced uses ONLY)

If you are using hierarchical authorities (account and/or active permissions), backing up your keys alone may not be sufficient to regain access to your funds! Please revise the documentations about hierarchical authorities.
