[# 收费部门]

#### 收费部门

每次{account} 支付交易费时, 该费用会在几个不同的账户中划分。 该网络采取{networkFee}% 减价, 终身成员推荐用户{account} 会得到一个{lifetimeFee}% 减价。

* 注册服务商 * 是收取交易费用、帮您注册{account} 帐户的服务账号。 The registrar gets to decide how to divide the remaining {referrerTotalFee}% between themselves and their own *Affiliate Referrer* program.

{account}'s registrar chose to share {referrerFee}% of the total fee with the *Affiliate Referrer* and keep {registrarFee}% of the total fee for themselves.

#### Pending Fees

Fees paid by {account} are only divided among the network, referrers, and registrars once every maintenance interval ({maintenanceInterval} seconds). The next maintenance time is {nextMaintenanceTime}.

#### Vesting Fees

Most fees are made available immediately, but fees over {vestingThreshold} (such as those paid to upgrade your membership or register a premium account name) must vest for a total of {vestingPeriod} days.
